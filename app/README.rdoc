== README

This app is a quick & dirty translation manager for ruby on rails.
It watches html-files in a directory and uses Active Admin for editing them.
Pretty old active_admin_editor is used as Rich Format Editor.
Version control is included via paper trail.

== Installation
1. The usual rails conf and bundle install crap :-)
2. Set application.rb global variables
3. rake db:seed
4. rake dir:watch for observing the filesystem in background. 

<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
